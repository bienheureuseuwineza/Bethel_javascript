        Cinderella, the most popular of all fairy tales, is a time-less story of
        virtue rewarded. Sweet, beautiful Cinderella, cruelly mistreated by her
        evil stepmother and stepsisters, is helped by her magical fairy
        godmother, who sends her off to win the heart of a handsome prince and
        live happily ever after. Anthea Bell’s graceful translation of this
        classic tale is faithful to the original, yet accessible to today’s
        children.

        Cinderella teaches the morals of kindness towards all, forgiving others
        for doing wrong, and never letting bad things ruin your heart. The
        themes of the story are good versus evil and luck changing your life.
